        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><I>"I'm Muhammad Sabih Ud Din Khan, an AI developer and full-stack engineer based in Lahore, Pakistan, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at NUCES. I build things that sit at the intersection of artificial intelligence and real-world utility — from prompt injection detection systems and RAG-powered course assistants to fully automated e-commerce pipelines and voice-controlled AI assistants.
            My work is driven by a simple belief: technology should do the heavy lifting so people don't have to. Whether I'm fine-tuning transformer models, architecting workflow automations with n8n, or shipping a full-stack web application from scratch, my focus stays on building systems that are not just smart — but actually useful.
            When I'm not deep in code, I'm exploring new AI tools, pitching ideas at business competitions, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the tools available today. I'm always building, always learning, and always looking for the next problem worth solving."</I></p>
